** how z80 actually starts up

When the CPU starts running (which basically happens as soon as it
receives power and is reset with the RESET pin), it begins to pull
instructions from memory and execute them. Where it starts in memory
depends on the individual CPU, but in the case of the Z80, it simply
begins at memory address 0, instead of using a reset vector like many
other CPUs do. This means that any computer using the Z80 *must* have
a ROM chip at memory address 0 which gives the initial start-up
instructions to the Z80.

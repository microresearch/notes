All technology that is derived of earth, must be decomposed and again reduced to earth.
[Basil Valentine]

Old earth, no more lies, I've seen you, it was me, with my other ravening eyes, too late.
[Samuel Beckett]

Circulations of media through the matters and bodies of the earth and
atmosphere, and through a certain corruption or dissolution of
(digital) identity, meaning and description.

We will collectively explore the interfaces and exchanges between
living systems (earth, compost, worms, mycelium) and active audio
electronics. We will participate primarily with our hands and our ears
within circulations amongst earths, composts, mushroom mycelium,
moulds, active chemistry, worms, crows, dusts, smokes and fogs and
impulses and waves.

During the workshop we will construct a series of open circuits which
do not conceal their materiality but participate equally within
material and electrochemical exchanges and circulations.*

These circuits are inspired through a media archaeology of electronic
music production, and through the history of alchemical engagement
with minerals, with decay and with the earth. These technical and
conceptual influences are equally opened to circulation and corruption
during the workshop.

We will work with a range of materials (for example, machine cut
copper sheets and oyster mushroom mycelium) and approaches (for
example, with radio transmission and signal reception) to design and
build these open circuits which will enter into processes of
appreciable decay, corruption and dissolution. These open circuits
will be placed during the workshop in selected interior and exterior
locations to participate in various time scales of deterioration and
degradation.

* Questions/terms

What is it about circulation that encourages corruption, putrefaction and decay?

How can we think of corruption in terms of material and/of media?

Ideas like parasitism, degradation of information, making present of a material
substrate and material constraints, signals disturbed/noise, muddied,
what it means to corrupt something, to bend towards additional/other senses, to
degrade signals.

What are media and signal parasites? Pharmaceuticals for example,
dusts and particles from industrial productions, radioactive isotopes.

What are the connections between technolgies of electronics and
feedback, parasitic feedback/effects and putrefaction?

*  

Circulations between earths, contained bodies (humans, worms and
crows), plants, mushroom mycelium, atmospheres, technologies and
infrastructures

Of particles, charges, electrons, energies, waves, polarisations, signals, noise, of media

And within circulations amongst earths, composts, mushroom mycelium,
moulds, active chemistry, worms, crows, dusts, smokes and fogs and
impulses and waves.

This is what we will work with. All is in circulation.

The way up and the way down [are] one and the same [...] Fire, water,
earth are the way down, and earth, water, fire is the way up. And
these two ways are forever being traversed in opposite directions at once.

[Heraclitus]

* Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing. The Mushroom at the End of the World

We are contaminated by our encounter; they change who we are as we
make way for others. As contamination changes world-making projects,
mutual worlds and new directions may emerge. Everyone carries a
history of contamination; purity is not an option. 

Collaboration means working across difference, which leads to
contamination. Without collaborations, we all die.

Telegraph and telephone signals were returned through the earth, and a
ground meant the ground underneath people's feet; information was
underground information. Earth currents associated with auroral
display and storms on the sun were sensed on telegraph lines and heard
on the telephone.

.. that is by a hyemal winter fire, with which she rotteth; & then
with a vernal or spring firre by which it groweth & indueth his green
mantle; & then with his aestival or summer heat, by which he
flourisheth & putteth on a crest or helmet of a more golden colour,
hastening by this intense agent unto his maturity; and lastly he
changeth that fire to an autumnal or harvest operation by which the
mark of maturity so aimed at all the year is touched on the very head
that then corruption may begin again.

the bands of those four elements which did preserve that vegetable
form until in a manner I had deprived it of quite all shape, & reduced
the whole body unto a muddy or slimy substance ... "]

This Dissolution is nothing but a killing of the moist with the dry,
in fact a PUTREFACTION, and consequently turns the MATTER black.

It is a living thing, which no more dies, but when used gives an eternal increase.

Let the waters above the heavens fall and the earth will yield its fruit.

The Soul is extracted by Putrefaction, and when nothing more of the
soul remains, then have you well washed the Body, that they both again
are one.


* Aurora Consurgens (15c)

THE  FIRST  PARABLE:  OF  THE   BLACK  EARTH  WHEREIN  THE  SEVEN  PLANETS  TOOK  ROOT

Beholding from afar off I saw a great cloud looming black over the
whole earth, which had absorbed the earth and covered my soul, because
the waters had come in even unto her, wherefore they were putrefied
and corrupted before the face of the lower hell and the shadow of
death, for a tempest hath overwhelmed me

* Donum Dei (15c)

The Head of the Crow is black earth and feculent in the which be
engendered worms, whereof the one devoureth the other, for the
corruption of the one is the generation of the other.

The black clouds descendeth unto the body from whence they came out
and there is made connection between the earth and water and is made
ashes. The crow is black, the Dove is white, the Phoenix burneth


* Ripley Putrefaction (16c)

This text has been modernised by Adam McLean from the 1591 edition of The Compound of Alchymy. 

THE FIFTH GATE - PUTREFACTION

Now we begin the chapter of Putrefaction,
Without which pole no seed may multiply,
Which must be done only by continual action,
Of heat in the body, moist not manually.
For bodies else may not be altered naturally,
Since Christ doth witness, unless the grain of wheat die in the ground,
Increase may thou not get.

And likewise unless the matter putrefy,
It may in no way truly be altered,
Neither may thy elements be divided kindly,
Nor the conjunction of them perfectly celebrated,
That thy labour therefore be not frustrated,
The privitie of our putrefying well understand,
Before ever you take this work in hand.

And Putrefaction may thus be defined, after philosophers sayings,
To be the slaying of bodies,
And in our compound a division of things three,
Leading forth into the corruption of killed bodies,
And after enabling them unto regeneration,
For things being in the earth, without doubt,
Be engendered of rotation in the heavens about.

* Earth circulations

The circulatory system of an earth addiction encompassing extraction
(of precious metals, of radioactive minerals), transport (along old
and new Silk Roads) and consumption (the ingestion of earth-derived
energies, materialities and earth-bound pharmaceutical products) and
return or excretion (traces of isotopes and pollution elements in the
body).

* The air

file:resources/invasionsm.jpg

* 

No more fruit, no more trees, no more vegetables, no more plants
pharmaceutical or otherwise and consequently no more food, but
synthetic products to satiety, amid the fumes, amid the special humors
of the atmosphere, on the particular axes of atmospheres wrenched
violently and synthetically from the resistances of a nature which has
known nothing of war except fear.

[Antonin Artaud. To have done with the Judgement of God.]

The health of any body is the concern of an interior against any
outside, of a border and a boundary. The earth or body fortress is
assailed by demonic winds and breath from outside its protecting
walls. Spiritus mali, under the sign of four demons, designated as
four elements, enter the body through gaps in the enclosing skin,
through the mouth and the open pores.

Guarded by four angels, the body becoming earth is concerned with its
proper health as its property, rather than that of its improper
parasites.

What could it then mean to talk about the health of an earth or
planet, its body and properties?

Fludd was correct in shaming the elements as evil agents in disease;
monocultures of gold, iron and oxygen binding to cyanide, unable to
sustain any form of life. Monocultures of wheat are set out on that
outside drifting landscape. How does a toxic site appear, what could a
poisonous or poisoned geology be? (Chernobyl ref)

... the incorruptible spirit ... sendeth his beames of life ouer all the
whole frame of man, to illuminate, give life, and circular motion vnto
his spirit.

... the sun impresses on the wind a circular motion, breathed
in, and reaching the heart, is carried around the body in circulation

Serpent Lucifer, how do you do?

Of your worms and your snakes Iâ€™d be one or two;

For in this dear planet of wool and of leather

â€˜Tis pleasant to need neither shirt, sleeve, nor shoe,

And have arm, leg, and belly together.

[Thomas Beddoes. 1850]

Over the last year, a container of worms dieting on rotting coffee
grains and waste vegetables have composed an ever-lengthening French
language text which now numbers over 9000 pages. The compost worms
have been provided with an electronic and software interface to a
virtual typewriter. Tiny electrical changes within the worm's compost,
which correspond to the worm's activity and movement allow the worms
to writhe and wriggle through a French language probability table to
actively steer the generation of this piece of writing; worms.txt.

* Circulation and corruption in electronics and electronic music (production)

All circuits are circulations. All circuits take part in earth/ed circulations.

Short circuit. Grounded. Open circuit. Open loop. Closed loop.

What is a circuit/circulation? For example, how is it described

* (negative) feedback in electronics

file:resources/feedback.png

Paul Voigt patented a negative feedback amplifier in January 1924,
though his theory lacked detail. Harold Stephen Black independently
invented the negative-feedback amplifier while he was a passenger on
the Lackawanna Ferry (from Hoboken Terminal to Manhattan) on his way
to work at Bell Laboratories (located in Manhattan instead of New
Jersey in 1927) on August 2, 1927. 

Black was working on reducing distortion in repeater
amplifiers used for telephone transmission. On a blank space in his
copy of The New York Times, he recorded the diagram found in Figure
1 and the equations derived below. On August 8, 1928, Black
submitted his invention to the U. S. Patent Office, which took more
than 9 years to issue the patent. Black later wrote: "One reason for
the delay was that the concept was so contrary to established beliefs
that the Patent Office initially did not believe it would work."

* Common electronic audio circuits - oscillation, filters

* oscillation is feedback

* positive feedback

file:resources/osc4.jpeg

Positive feedback must occur only at one frequency, the required frequency
of oscillation. This may be achieved by ensuring that only signals of
the required frequency are fed back, or by ensuring the feedback
signal is in the correct phase at only one frequency.

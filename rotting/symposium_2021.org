* Deprecation: Rotting Registers /// (25 minutes) presentation

** 1- what is a SR? with lots of diagrams, audio examples maybe, what it is used for

In the rarified realm of digital designers, an equivalent to the
Ouroboros is the linear-feedback-shift register (LFSR), in which the
output from a standard-shift register is manipulated and fed back to
its input so as to cause the function to endlessly cycle through a
sequence of patterns.

Much like the Ouroboros, LFSRs keep on rearing their heads again and
again and again, because however much you know, there are always more
tricks to learn. The great psychoanalyst Carl Jung speculated that the
Ouroboros could be part of the collective consciousness, so had he
dabbled in electronics, he may well have considered LFSRs to form part
of the digital consciousness. Hold onto that couch, Carl; Iâ€™m on my
way! [EDN website/beebop boolean boogie]

describe an obsession - SR as ouroboros, SR as Swiss project title, SR
as geological, as depth and as circulation, enacted in bits in
algorithmic time, SR as particulate.

serial to parallel

** 2- feedback loops, geological feedback loops - images form stack, frame, heap

we inhale and ingest our own geological indicators (metals, isotopes, markers)

that it is not outside us, we eat and inhale our own - belonging to
us, anthropogenic - signifiers of the becoming geological (not just
marking an outside, but an inside, a double psychological loop)

** 3- what SR in the earth could be - as intro to becoming geological

becoming geo-logical!

becoming geological, preserved, immortal, supposedly protected against decay. to be immortal is to be dead.

logic is antithetical and opposed to the earth

what are the naive necessities for logic or SR in the earth:

- that it must be transmissable and measurable (it cannot be indeterminate or die out)
- that it must be within the limit of certain thresholds (to signify a 1 or a 0 and be able to pass this on)
- non-linearity of logical operations (eg. XOR)
- bounded cells, no leakage, no less, no decay
- it can be clocked or strobed to define certain operations - the timing is event-driven, of thresholds, discontinuous and discrete
- that the measurable nature of the energetic transforms employed (eg. electrochemical, thermodynamic) are common to input and outputs
- that the measurable nature of the energetic transforms is not subject to interference from other flows or transformations

what types of logic are there? such as fluid gates, heat gates

** conclusion - particulate logics maybe?

*** notes on particles and becoming geological to incorporate [mummy, chinese alch images]

- link SR and Tiny Mining

I started thinking about the ingestion of particles, starting to think
if this becoming geology through ingestion is not so foreign to
humanity so far - the project of a becoming immortal as a dead or
undecaying geological mummy. The anthropocene could be seen as some
kind of circular ingestion of the markers of our own entry into
geological timeframes, which seems to have a familiar logic!

if the project of humanity is not this becoming geological - becoming
immortal as a dead or undying body of jade or mercury (Chinese Alchemy)

the questionable term of the anthropocene is re-written as the
ingestion and inhalation of our "own" entry point into geological
time. (explain this with ref to radioactive tracers, markers)

radio-active dating slewed by ingestion and uptake of anthrogenic markers  (another feedback loop)

- feedback loops of warming and particulate exhalations of burning forests

* Towards a USB-powered invocation/instruction

- list of possible invocations as array in FLASH

- we need to retrieve these in new order and so is exactly 512 bytes (can pad out to this with zeroes) TEST this in c code...

or we can make it 1420 bytes?

- test moon code - either we use moon degrees/house to select or we
  only deliver when moon is in LIBRA (180 to 210 degrees) for
  necromancy and issue statement to this effect

PGM VII 284-99

Orbit of the Moon. In Libra: necromancy.

- add in RTC code for 1307

- test all together and cast

* code is in 

  /root/notes_and_projectsNOW/contiguity_res/software/enstix/sources:

but apart from LUFA copy here for git

* sources for invocations

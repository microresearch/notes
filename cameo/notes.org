* from kicad to cutout

** new working

- in kicad/pcbnew PLOT layer as dxf
- open it in librecad
- export as maker svg
- open in inkscape and outline should be fine - check size

** older not really working

- plot as svg in kicad
-> inkscape path tool
- select lines/tracks bit by bit with
- stroke to path and then union of those paths
- keep going by hand... ctrl-x delete inside path pads
- add pads also

new one pdf/noembed - outline mode ??? 

, select all, paths->combine, select all, use path too, and delete inside paths - somehow???

- in inkscape -> extensions -> export -> send to silhouette // do settings work there????

what works best - try 

we have manual setting close to 2: and 2,10 for cutting vinyl itself - but settings in inkscape don't effect anything!

set to around 1 now

but that is not enough for vinyl/copper on tonpaper - 

weigert extension - best one?

for pen we adjust height manually...

think about conversion to svg maybe by way of kicad?

* tracing and conversion to svg

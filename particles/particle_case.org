* notes for case

** TESTING:

- PMx2X, PWMx2X, PWMwithheatX, PWmwithfans-very low range 200->255 values as has filter, diodesX, relays/coolingsX 



** power guide/outs/ins

12v is general/for laser, PM // +/-12V for diodes/pwm

[q what is 2nd voltage out for?] none/nowhere!

where is voltage for PM sensors? from main 12v

fans is 12v in, relays 12v 

heat voltages (from other box), light outs and PM outs

left fan routes in, right is outwards

** particle-control.ino

// commands: T, U, V to show temperature
// W to write integer to analogwrite pin 3, E to write pin 10
// Z, X: on off relay1 pin 7:
// A, S: on off relay2 pin 6:
// command Q/ESC exit// to send code to target platform for temp readings (serial on pins A0 and A1 say which is analogue A0, A1)

** particles.py

example python code to send commands to case (here we measure first temp (mid one)) and then send to pwm one

** pwm outputs from case

pwm1 is second from edge, 2 is furthest - up to 10v from arduino, uses +12v/-12v? supply

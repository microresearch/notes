* notes 1 July

- various experiments applying controlled heat (nichrome wire gird or
  bed) to atmega168/328 (SMD and DIP)

- audio generated by simply running through a buffer in memory at say
  16k samples per second. tried PWM playback but settled on one bit
  playback - high or low bit depending on memory byte (> 128)

- buffer is the result of repeatedly hashing a sample/test phrase with
  SHA256 algorithm borrowed from ...

- 261, 262 wavs - most successful demonstrate glitches above 120
  degrees (recorded with PT100/MAX31865 combo) on other side of DIP IC
  in this case) - crashing and reboot in 262 until power connection
  melts off - logfile for temperatures here is heatsick1jul3.log

- heatsick1jul2.log is for 261.wav - audio starts with log

- 263 wav repeated reboots - and re-apply heat - but carries on over 150 degrees

- exec1july.log is plain log of temperature during execution of the same algorithm

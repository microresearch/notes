Information is stored in the earth, in the air, and in the light. In
the earth, as magnetic impulses, taking advantage of the
... properties of certain metals and stones.

In the air, just as in a fluid, data can be stored as a reflecting
acoustic wave or as a rebounding electromagnetic signal.

In the light, bits of information are stored and retrieved as visible
emissions from excited phosphorescent particles which glow and fade.

These methods are all dependent on the reading and re-writing, or
refreshing of data to insure its longevity, its ... against inevitable
decay.
